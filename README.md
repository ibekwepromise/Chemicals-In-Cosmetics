## Chemicals-In-Cosmetics: What's On Your Face and Body!!
In a world where beauty trends are constantly changing, itâ€™s important to have a deeper understanding of the ingredients/chemicals in the products we use daily. In this project, I will explore the fascinating world of cosmetics, looking at the chemicals compositions that make each product and uncovering insights that help us understand their effects better, gain valuable knowledge to make informed decisions about our skincare and beauty routines. 

Cosmetics have been an integral part of human culture for millennia, dating back to ancient civilizations. However, the formulations and ingredients have evolved significantly over time, incorporating a diverse array of chemicals to achieve desired effects. Each products category from skincare products, baby products, fragrances, makeup products, hair-care products to oral hygiene products contains a complex blend of substances carefully selected for their properties. 

## ABOUT THE DATASET  
The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/chemicals-in-cosmetics-what-s-really-in-your) 

The dataset provides comprehensive information about cosmetic products from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), including details such as product names, companies, brands, primary and sub-categories, and chemical compositions. It contains internal identification numbers for products, companies, categories, sub-categories, and chemicals as well as Chemical Abstracts Services (CAS) numbers for the chemicals. Additionally, the dataset includes dates related to the reporting, creation, updating and removal of chemicals from products, as well as the date when a chemical was discontinued.  

With 114,299 rows and 23 columns, this dataset offers a detailed perspective on the cosmetics industries, facilitating analysis of chemical usage, product formulations and regulatory compliance. 

I used Microsoft SQL Server, with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) as the integrated development environment (IDE) for querying and managing the database.

## PROJECT QUESTIONS/BUSINESS GOAL 
The main goal of this project is to explore various aspects of the dataset, including product distribution, chemical usage and company practices, providing insights into the landscape of cosmetics and their chemical compositions. In order to achieve this goal, I will be answering the following business questions.
